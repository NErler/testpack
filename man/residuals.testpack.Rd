\arguments{
\item{object}{object inheriting from class 'testpack'}

\item{type}{type of residuals: \code{"deviance"}, \code{"response"},
\code{"working"}}

given directly by \strong{testpack}.)}

\section{Note}{

\itemize{
\item For mixed models residuals are currently calculated using the fixed
      effects only.
\item For ordinal (mixed) models and parametric survival models only
      \code{type = "response"} is available.
\item For Cox proportional hazards models residuals are not yet implemented.
